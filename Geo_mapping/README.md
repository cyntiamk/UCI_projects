# Visualizing Data with Leaflet
The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes


## Task

### Basic Visualization
Visualize an earthquake data set.

1. **Get the data set**

 GeoJson data link for 'All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days': "https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson"


2. **Import & Visualize the Data**

   Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from your data set based on their longitude and latitude.

   * The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and darker in color.

   * Popups provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

### More Data show Fault Lines


The second plot a utilizes a dataset illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. The link with coordinates necessary to plot the fault lines: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fraxen/tectonicplates/master/GeoJSON/PB2002_steps.json"

* Plot a second dataset on the map.

* Add a number of base maps to choose from as well as separate out our two different data sets into overlays that can be turned on and off independently.

* Add layer controls to the map.
